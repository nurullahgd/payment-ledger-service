A multi-tenant payment ledger service built in Go. Each merchant operates in an isolated PostgreSQL schema. Transactions are processed asynchronously via a worker pool, with webhook notifications delivered on terminal states.

### Key Design Decisions

**Schema-per-tenant isolation**

Each merchant gets a dedicated PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{merchant_id}`), containing its own `transactions`, `balances`, and `ledger` tables. This provides complete data isolation at the SQL level — a query in one tenant's schema cannot access another tenant's data, unlike row-level security which requires careful filter management.

**SELECT FOR UPDATE for balance consistency**

When processing a transaction, the worker acquires a row-level lock on the `balances` row before reading the balance:

```sql
SELECT available_balance FROM tenant_x.balances WHERE merchant_id = $1 FOR UPDATE
```

This ensures two concurrent debits cannot both read the same balance and both succeed — the second waits for the first to commit before reading the updated value. Proven by `TestProcessTransaction_ParallelDebit_NoOverdraft`.

**Sliding window rate limiting**

Uses a Redis sorted set per merchant. Each request adds a timestamped entry, old entries outside the window are removed, and the count is compared against the limit — all in a single pipeline. Unlike a fixed window (which allows burst at window boundary), the sliding window enforces a consistent rate across any 60-second span.

**Idempotency via Redis**

Before inserting a transaction, the handler checks a Redis key `idempotency:{merchantID}:{reference}`. If it exists, the cached response is returned with `Idempotency-Replayed: true`. If not, the transaction is inserted, queued, and the key is set with 24h TTL. The `Get` and `Set` are intentionally separate: the key is only set after the DB insert succeeds, so the transaction ID is available to cache.

**Asynchronous processing with graceful shutdown**

Transactions are accepted immediately (HTTP 202), inserted as `pending`, then queued to the worker pool. On `SIGTERM`, the HTTP server stops accepting new requests, the task channel is closed, and the pool waits for all in-flight workers to finish before the process exits.

**Webhook delivery with retry**

After a transaction reaches a terminal state (`completed` or `failed`), the worker fires an HTTP POST to the merchant's `webhook_url` with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s, max 3 attempts). Webhook failure does not affect transaction state.

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The service starts on `http://localhost:8080`. Two test merchants are seeded automatically:

| Merchant | API Key | Currency |
|---|---|---|
| Merchant 1 | `sk_test_12345` | USD |
| Merchant 2 | `sk_test_67890` | EUR |

## API Reference

All endpoints (except `/health`) require the `X-API-Key` header.

### Submit Transaction

```
POST /api/v1/transactions
X-API-Key: sk_test_12345
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "reference": "order-001",
  "type": "credit",
  "amount": 1500,
  "description": "Payment received"
}
```

Response `202 Accepted`:
```json
{ "id": "uuid", "status": "pending", "reference": "order-001" }
```

Submitting the same `reference` again returns the original response with `Idempotency-Replayed: true`.

### Get Balance

```
GET /api/v1/balance
X-API-Key: sk_test_12345
```

### List Transactions

```
GET /api/v1/transactions?status=completed&page=1&limit=20
```

`status` filter: `pending` | `completed` | `failed`

### Get Transaction

```
GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}
```

### List Ledger Entries

```
GET /api/v1/ledger?page=1&limit=20
```

### Health Check

```
GET /health
```

```json
{ "db": "ok", "cache": "ok" }
```

Returns `503` if either dependency is unavailable.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://ledger_user:ledger_password@localhost:5433/ledger_db?sslmode=disable` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_ADDR` | `localhost:6379` | Redis address |
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `WORKER_COUNT` | `5` | Number of background worker goroutines |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | `60` | Max requests per merchant per 60 seconds |

## Amount Unit

All `amount` values are in the **smallest currency unit** (cents for USD, kuruş for TRY). This avoids floating-point precision issues.

| amount value | USD | TRY |
|---|---|---|
| `100` | $1.00 | ₺1,00 |
| `1500` | $15.00 | ₺15,00 |
| `10000` | $100.00 | ₺100,00 |

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./...

# With race detector (recommended)
go test -race ./...

# Integration tests (requires running PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://ledger_user:ledger_password@localhost:5433/ledger_db?sslmode=disable \
  go test -race -v ./internal/repository/... -run "TestProcessTransaction"
```

Integration tests in `internal/repository/ledger_repository_integration_test.go` are skipped automatically when `DATABASE_URL` is not set. In CI, they run as part of the full test suite since `DATABASE_URL` is provided.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs three parallel jobs on every push:

- **lint** — `golangci-lint` (errcheck, staticcheck, govet, gofmt, unused)
- **test** — `go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` with PostgreSQL and Redis services
- **build** — Docker multi-stage image build

## Redis Usage

Redis is used in two places, both chosen deliberately over alternatives:

**Idempotency cache** — When a transaction is submitted, the handler checks a Redis key `idempotency:{merchantID}:{reference}` before hitting the database. If the key exists, the cached response is returned immediately with `Idempotency-Replayed: true`. The key is set after the DB insert succeeds, so the real transaction ID is always in the cached response. TTL is 24 hours. If Redis is unavailable, the request falls through to the DB — the `UNIQUE` constraint on `reference` acts as a second line of defence against duplicates.

**Per-merchant rate limiting** — A sliding window counter is stored as a Redis sorted set (`ratelimit:{merchantID}`). Each request adds a timestamped member, old members outside the 60-second window are removed, and the count is compared against the limit — all in a single pipeline. This is inherently distributed: multiple service instances share the same counters without coordination overhead.

Redis is **not** used as a job queue. The worker pool uses an in-memory Go channel, which is simpler operationally. The trade-off is that pending tasks are lost on restart — a persistent queue (Kafka, SQS) would solve this and is listed as a future improvement.

## Design Tradeoffs

| Decision | Alternative | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Schema-per-tenant | Row-level security | Complete SQL-level isolation, no risk of missing a WHERE clause |
| Sliding window rate limit | Token bucket | No burst at window boundary; counts real requests in rolling window |
| Redis idempotency (Get + Set) | Single atomic SETNX | Allows caching the real transaction ID after DB insert |
| Worker pool queue (channel) | External queue (e.g. Kafka) | Simpler operationally; acceptable for moderate throughput |
| Async processing (202) | Sync processing (200/201) | Decouples HTTP latency from DB transaction time |

## Future Improvements

- Persistent job queue (Kafka / SQS) for webhook delivery across restarts
- Webhook delivery log table for audit and replay
- Prometheus metrics (queue depth, processing latency, webhook success rate)
- Pagination cursor (keyset) instead of offset for large datasets
- OpenAPI / Swagger documentation
